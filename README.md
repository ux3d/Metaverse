# Gestaltor in the Metaverse
[Gestaltor](https://gestaltor.io/) is the first visual [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) editor to directly modify `.gltf` and `.glb` files. One of the [main features](https://ux3d.io/gestaltor) of this editor is, that a glTF is loaded and saved. This means, that any information and configuration inside the glTF during editing is preserved.  
  
glTF is the 3D format of choice for [non-fungible tokens (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), in the [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse) and [3D Commerce](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/).  
  
Following assets do help to create content using Gestaltor for the following metaverse platforms.

## General

Like in the real world, meters are also used as units in virtual space and the metaverse.  
Following ruler does have a size of 0.1 x 2.0 x 0.1 meters, which does easily allow size comparisson and adjustments.  
In this scene, an avatar from [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) and a chair from [wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-blog/welcome-to-wayfairs-realtime-3d-model-api) are compared:
