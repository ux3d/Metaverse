# Gestaltor in the Metaverse
[Gestaltor](https://gestaltor.io/) is the first visual [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) editor. One of the main features is, that glTF is loaded and saved (and not imported and exported).  
This is a big advantage, as any information stored in the glTF is not lost.  
  
glTF is the format of choice in the metaverse and [3D Commerce](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/) and we continously add new features to Gestaltor, to fulfill the demands from the community.  
  
Following assets do help to create content using Gestaltor for the following Metaverse platforms.

## Decentraland
In [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) it is possible to add own 3D models using glTF.  

### LAND
3D models can be placed on a [LAND](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#what-is-land) estate. A LAND estate does have a dimension of [16m x 16m](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#how-large-is-a-tile-of-land).  
The following asset does have a dimension of 16m x 16m in glTF plus a checkerboard texture of 1m x 1m:
