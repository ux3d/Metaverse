# Gestaltor in the Metaverse
[Gestaltor](https://gestaltor.io/) is the first visual [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) editor. One of the main features is, that glTF is loaded and saved (and not imported and exported).  
This is a big advantage, as any information stored in the glTF is not lost.  
  
glTF is the format of choice in the metaverse and [3D Commerce](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/) and we continously add new features to Gestaltor, to fulfill the demands from the community.  
  
Following assets do help to create content using Gestaltor for the following Metaverse platforms.

## General

In general, meters are also used as units in virtual space and the metaverse.  
Following ruler does have a size of 0.1 x 2.0 x 0.1 meters, which does easily allow size comparisson.
